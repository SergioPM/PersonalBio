  <h1><u>General Introduction</u></h1>
  <p>
    I was born in Guatemala and have been raised in Oakland California for more
    than half of my life. I went to the same school from sixth to twelvth grade
    and graduated with a class of about 60 students. At first I was interested
    in Mechanical Engineering but a friend introduced me to Computer Information
    Systems and I decided to pursue it because it sounded interesting. So I'm here
    at Chico State and plan on graduating in four years or less.
