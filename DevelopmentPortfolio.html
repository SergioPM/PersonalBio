  <p><b>My Repositories</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><a class="pop" href="https://github.com/SergioPM/Margaret-Hamilton">Margaret Hamilton</a></li>
  </ul>
    <p>This was my very first repository and I worked on making a bio on a
      famous computer scientist.
  <ul>
    <li><a class="pop" href="https://github.com/SergioPM/ProfessorPage">Professor Page</a></li>
  </ul>
    <p>This repository was about the professors schedule. It showed the courses
      he had to teach and the some of the times he had to be there.
  <ul>
    <li><a class="pop"href="https://github.com/SergioPM/ChicoInShort">Chico In Short</a></li>
  </ul>
    <p>Here, it talked about the city of Chico. It gave some quick facts and
      this is where we learned how to write link in an HTML page.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a class="pop" href="https://github.com/SergioPM/MovieSpoiler">Movie Spoiler</a></li>
  </ul>
    <p>For this, I talked about my favorite movie and gave some information on it.
      I learned the hover tag and used it in this page.
  <ul>
    <li><a class="pop" href="https://github.com/SergioPM/BuildingTabs">Building Tabs</a>
  </ul>
    <p>To me this was one of the more confusing ones. I designed a page that has
      tabs and these tabs are basically links that lead to other pages. The outcome
      was pretty good looking and had some good color schemes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a class="pop" href="https://github.com/SergioPM/MySchedule">My Schedule</a>
  </ul>
    <p>For this last repository, I was suppose to work on a school schedule put
      in a chart. I changed the color of it and every time you hover or a class,
      its background color and text color changes.</p>
