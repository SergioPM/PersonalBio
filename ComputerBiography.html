  <h1><u>Computing Biography</u></h1>
  <p>Starting high school, I was not thinking of college at the time so of
    course I had no idea of what I wanted to be. As I started to join more
    programs, they were influencing me to go to college. At the same time
    I started to learn more about it and its benefits. I relized I was pretty
    okay with math and often helped other students with it. Because of this,
    I automatically thought I could be an engineer. However, I always had a
    small but pretty good interest in computers but just did not know where
    to go to get more information about computers. In my senior year, a really
    good friend helped me look for other potential majors I can change to and
    he told me about Computer Information Systems.</p>
  <p>Thinking back, I was always interested in computers and how they worked. I
    remember in one of my classes we were coding and making games and that was
    very interesting for me. If my school had any computer classes, which they
    didn't, I would have joined any. Additionally, I found the codes and symbols
    in coding really interesting when I watched movies. It looked very complex
    but I wanted to know what they meant. One last thing that really got me into
    computers was video games and hacking. To me, it was the most facinating
    thing when players hacked games during an online session or when they made
    modifications to the games. These few things have motivated me to pursue web
    development.</p>
